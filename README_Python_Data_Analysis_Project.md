# Python Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive guide to Python data analysis, starting from the basics and moving toward more advanced topics. It culminates in a final project that showcases practical applications of the concepts learned. Each section provides detailed examples, exercises, and code to help understand data analysis thoroughly.

## Folder Structure

1. **1_Basics**: Introduces the fundamentals of Python for data analysis. This section covers basic Python programming, data types, control flow, and basic operations in Pandas and Numpy.
2. **2_Advanced**: Builds on the basics and introduces more complex topics such as data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Advanced techniques in data wrangling with Pandas and Numpy are covered in this section.
3. **3_Project**: A final project that applies the concepts from both the basics and advanced sections to a real-world dataset. The project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize data to draw meaningful insights.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Learning Path**: Starts from the fundamentals and progresses to advanced data analysis techniques.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Includes a complete project that applies the skills learned in real-world scenarios.
- **Practical Examples**: Each section contains practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning.
